# Hi, I’m Dylan Putnam

 **Writer. Storyteller. Creator.**

By day, I'm diving into cybersecurity and tech. By night, I'm building emotionally raw fiction worlds with big hearts, sharp humor, and the occasional wind-powered protagonist.

##  What I’m Working On

-  **Libra** — A modern superhero story that mixes conspiracies, sarcastic banter, and a main character who talks too much and spirals more than he'd like to admit.
- **The Quiet Isn’t Quiet** — A stage play exploring mental illness, grief, and survivor’s guilt through a raw and claustrophobic one-room setting.
-  **Cybersecurity Skills** — Currently enrolled at Learning Alliance in Tampa, FL, and transitioning into the tech world with a background in phone tech and over 100 WPM typing speed.

##  Skills & Tools

- Creative Writing (Script, Prose, First-Person Fiction)
- Narrative Design & Worldbuilding
- Git & GitHub
- Terminal & Basic Linux Commands
- Network Security (in progress)
- Technical Support (T-Mobile & Verizon experience)

##  Fun Facts

- I’m a dog dad 
- I thrive in emotionally heavy writing, with a healthy dose of dry humor
- My superpower would be multitasking snark and sincerity
- Writing saved me — now I try to return the favor
